### 🎉🎉 Welcome

Hi, I'm Mike, a full-stack developer in Shenzhen, China. I'm now working at [Bridge5 Asia](https://github.com/bridge5) from April, 2020, focused on backend develoment on node.js

I believe softwares can give us lots of conveniences in work and life and save my time, that's why I developed apps or websites in needed. Last year, with my wife pregnant and then the birth of my son, I have finished some apps:

✨✨These days I'm focusing on designing and developing a personal knowledge center at part time, which is entirely upgrade from the old websites. **The Personal Knowledge Center**(short for PKC) is made up of various frontend & backend services. Basis tech-stacks are react.js for frontend and node.js for backend. I will share some of them named like `pkc-service-xxx` or `pkc-react-xxx`.
